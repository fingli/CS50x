My name is Yulian Yordanov
from Bulgaria

This is a presentation of my final project 
for CS50x 

It's an web application - a simple searching tool
for finding recent images in Flickr
from a given username

To build it I used PHP, Flickr API more exactly its php-forked version,
Bootstrap for styling and MVC model as a file structure

Let's go there

For the purpose of the presentation I will search for my photos

Here you see my last photos uploaded in Flickr 

Images are linked to their original addresses 

By default Flickr API returns up to one hundred results
The reason that they are twelve here,
is only for the sake of the design

Let's try another username

This also can be used for creating a simple portfolio page
Like this of my photos

Because the script fetches most recent photos
every time the user uploads a new photo to Flickr
it will appear in the portfolio as well

So, that's it
Thank you for watching
This was CS50
